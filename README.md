# CTF-WriteUps

CTFing is one of my core passions. The thrill, adrenaline rush, long-hours of picking hairs in the quest to solve a challenge, all give me such pleasure that tbh I dont find anywhere else. I believe knowledge is enhanced and refined, when shared. So, this is where this repo comes in that'll contain my writeups of the challenges I could solve in different CTFs.

Note: I only include writeups of interesting challenges from among the ones I solve because you can find plenty of resources in the internet for trivial ones.

### A little bit of my CTF History: 

I started doing CTFs in solo from 2017 and fell in love with it :) In 2018, I joined team [irNoobs](https://ctftime.org/team/70393) and continued till the end of 2021. In 2022, I built my own university team [IUT GENESIS](https://ctftime.org/team/175924) and has been one of the top teams of my country since then. Even though its almost 5 years into my CTF journey, it wasn't until late 2022 that I started doing writeups for my solved challenges. Thats why there's not many writeups as there should've been for someone who's CTFing for a few years :) Anyways, its a start I guess.
