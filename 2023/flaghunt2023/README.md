As part of the qualifier for **flaghunt2023**, a national Capture The Flag event organized by the CTF Community BD, I developed two `pwn` challenges, namely [Baby Witcher](https://github.com/peace-ranger/CTF-WriteUps/tree/main/2023/flaghunt2023/Qualifier/Baby%20Witcher) and Monster ARM, to assess basic Binary Exploitation skills among contestants and to encourage beginners to learn more about binary exploitation. 

These challenges were designed to test the fundamental concepts of Binary Exploitation and were aimed at beginners, with the intention of providing a foundation for further learning.
