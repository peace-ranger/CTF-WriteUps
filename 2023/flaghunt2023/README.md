As part of the Qualifier for **flaghunt2023**, a national Capture The Flag event organized by the CTF Community BD, I developed two `pwn` challenges, namely [Baby Witcher](https://github.com/peace-ranger/CTF-WriteUps/tree/main/2023/flaghunt2023/Qualifier/Baby%20Witcher) and [Monster ARM](https://github.com/peace-ranger/CTF-WriteUps/tree/main/2023/flaghunt2023/Qualifier/Monster%20ARM), to assess basic Binary Exploitation skills among contestants and to encourage beginners to learn more about binary exploitation. For the Final, I made [Witcher Format](https://github.com/peace-ranger/CTF-WriteUps/tree/main/2023/flaghunt2023/Final/Witcher%20Format), which, as the name suggests, involves format string exploitation.

These challenges were designed to test the fundamental concepts of Binary Exploitation and were aimed at beginners, with the intention of providing a foundation for further learning.
