# Solution
So the task is to find out one member of the CTF organizer team who is in the top 3% of global leaderboard in tryhackme. This seemed like a long chase first but it was the 3rd member from their core team. It was Ankush Kaudi, the president of CyberCell VIIT. In his linkedin profile that I got from the team page, he mentioned that he is "TryHackMe Top 3% üèÜ" .

Then after some trial and error and utilizing the hint mentioned in challenge description, I found his tryhackme profile which was `https://tryhackme.com/p/ankushkaudi`. The flag was directly written in his profile.
