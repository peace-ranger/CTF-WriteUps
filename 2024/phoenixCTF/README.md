# PhoenixCTF 2024 - `memo` Pwn Series Writeup
I was the first to complete this series of 4 pwn challenges in [phoenixCTF 2024](https://ctf.threatsims.com/user/events/02716543-6c1b-40f2-95f6-ff4acee571e8) organized by ThreatSims. My overall position in the CTF was 5th.

The series included 4 standard pwn challenges of increasing difficulty, where the solution from the previous challenge could be used to complete the next one. The first three challenges had a secret function that could execute a shell, and each of them had a buffer overflow (bof) vulnerability. The objective was to utilize the bof to call the secret function and achieve shell execution. The first challenge, [memo-1](https://github.com/peace-ranger/CTF-WriteUps/tree/main/2024/phoenixCTF/memo_1), had no PIE, while the next one, [memo_2](https://github.com/peace-ranger/CTF-WriteUps/tree/main/2024/phoenixCTF/memo_2), had PIE enabled. [memo_3](https://github.com/peace-ranger/CTF-WriteUps/tree/main/2024/phoenixCTF/memo_3) had both PIE and Canary enabled. Finally, [memo_4](https://github.com/peace-ranger/CTF-WriteUps/tree/main/2024/phoenixCTF/memo_4) had both PIE and Canary enabled but no secret function, requiring a `ret2libc` attack to gain shell execution through libc functions.

I have written detailed writeups for each challenge and reused the same techniques from one challenge to the next. So, I described each technique in detail only in the first challenge where I used it and made a reference to it in the subsequent challenges. For a complete understanding of all the techniques, one should read these writeups in order.
